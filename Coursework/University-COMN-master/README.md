# CS3 Computer Communications and Networks

This repository contains my coursework for the 3rd Year [Computer Communications and Networks](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/comn) course, taken in 2010/2011. The coursework involved implementing four protocols for sending data: a naive send-and-forget UDP protocol, a stop-and-wait protocol, a go-back-N protocol, and a selective repeat protocol. The protocols dealt with only packet loss and as such do no checking for or correction of corrupted packets. During the coursework this was handled using a virtual machine to create a non-corrupting network - however all but the first protocol should still work on a normal computer network (the output file may simply be slightly corrupted.)

Information on building and running the code can be found in the original submission's README (README.ORIGINAL).

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
